ingredients:
    - 155 ml sunflower oil plus extra for greasing
    - 230 g self-raising flour
    - 1 tsp baking powder
    - 1.5 tsp ground cinnamon
    - 0.5 tsp Mixed Spice
    - 0.5 tsp Ground Ginger
    - 230 g light brown muscovado sugar
    - Finely grated zest of 1 satsuma or mandarin plus strips to decorate
    - 100 g pecans halved
    - 260 g carrots coarsely grated
    - 3 medium free-range eggs beaten
    - 50 g butter softened
    - 200 g full-fat cream cheese we recommend Philadelphia
    - 150 g icing sugar plus extra to dust
    - 2 tsp orange juice

directions:
    - Preheat the oven to 180°C/fan160°C/gas 4. Grease an 18cm loose-bottomed round cake tin and line the base with baking paper. Sift the flour, baking powder and spices into a large bowl. Add the sugar, zest, pecans and grated carrots, then stir until well combined. Stir in the beaten eggs and oil, then mix well.
    - Pour into the prepared cake tin and bake in the oven for 1 hour or until a skewer comes out clean. Transfer to a cooling rack, leave in the tin for 5 minutes, then turn out and leave to cool completely before icing.
    - For the icing, beat the butter in a large bowl with a hand mixer until really soft. Add the cream cheese and beat again until well mixed. Sift over the icing sugar, add the orange juice, then beat until smooth. Store, covered, in the fridge until needed.
    - To decorate, fill a piping bag fitted with a plain, small nozzle with icing, then carefully pipe lines across the top of the cake. Give the cake a quarter of a turn and pipe more lines across. Dust with a little icing sugar and scatter some grated satsuma/mandarin zest on the top.
